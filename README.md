# Retail-sales-analysis
Technical exam for job application analyzing retail sales data.
## Project Description
This project involves the analysis and prediction of customer behavior based on retail 
sales data. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis, clean the dataset, 
conduct a cohort analysis, build a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of 
repeat purchases, and create visualizations to support the findings.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a retail sales dataset provided by the UCI Machine 
Learning Repository. It contains transaction data from a retail company that sells 
unique products.
## Branches
The project will be developed across the following branches:

- `data-preparation`: This branch will be dedicated to the 
exploration and cleaning of data, including identifying patterns, 
handling missing values, and correcting data quality issues. 
Visualizations to understand the data will also be created in this 
branch.
- `analysis`: This branch will cover the complete analysis, including 
cohort analysis and further insights drawn from the data. 
Visualizations will be created to support the analysis findings.
- `modeling`: This branch will be focused on developing the 
predictive model to estimate the likelihood of repeat purchases. 
Visualizations related to the modelâ€™s performance and predictions 
will be included here.
